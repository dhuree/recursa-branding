# Identity

> Name, personality, and presentation of the Recursa brand

## Name

**Recursa** (reh-KUR-sah)

From Latin *recursus*, meaning "a running back" or "return." The name embodies the core concept: systems that loop back to improve themselves.

### What We Are NOT Called

- RecursA (mixed case)
- RECURSA (all caps, except in logos)
- Recursa.js/Recursa.py (we're language-agnostic)
- The Recursa (except in "The Recursa Framework")

## Taglines

### Primary
> Systems that learn to improve themselves.

### Alternatives (context-dependent)
- "Build systems that get better over time."
- "The meta-framework for self-improvement."
- "Where feedback loops become features."
- "From iteration to evolution."
- "It's loops all the way down."
- "Teach your code to teach itself."

## Symbols & Metaphors

### Primary Symbol: The Loop

A continuous, elegant loop represents recursion—the core pattern. Variations:
- Simple loop (primary)
- Nested loops (complexity)
- Spiral (evolution over time)
- Möbius strip (infinite continuity)

### Supporting Metaphors

- **Seeds & trees** - Systems grow from small starts
- **Mirrors facing mirrors** - Infinite reflection
- **Feedback loops in nature** - Ecosystems, evolution
- **Learning cycles** - Practice, reflect, improve

### Things We Avoid

- Robots/AI imagery (we're not an AI product)
- Gears/machinery (too mechanical, not organic)
- Rocket ships (startup cliché)
- Light bulbs (overused "innovation" symbol)

## Voice Examples

### Introducing Recursa

**Good:**
> "Recursa is a meta-framework for building systems that improve themselves. You define how your system works, how it evaluates itself, and how it learns—Recursa provides the architecture that makes it all connect."

**Not our voice:**
> "Recursa is a revolutionary AI-powered framework that will transform how you build software forever! Say goodbye to static systems!"

### Responding to a Question

**Good:**
> "Great question! The LOOP.md file defines your iteration cycle—what happens each time your system does a unit of work. Think of it as the heartbeat of self-improvement."

**Not our voice:**
> "Please refer to the documentation section 4.2.1 for information regarding iteration cycles."

### Celebrating a Win

**Good:**
> "The community just hit 1,000 stars! Thank you to everyone who's been building, experimenting, and sharing. Every contribution—code, docs, or questions—makes Recursa better."

**Not our voice:**
> "We're thrilled to announce this incredible milestone! Our exponential growth proves Recursa is the future of development!"

### Using Wit

**Good:**
> "To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion. Luckily, we wrote documentation."

> "Your system called itself. Your system called itself. Your system called itself. Stack overflow achieved."

> "LOOP.md: because 'do it again, but better' needed a formal specification."

**Not our voice (humor that misses):**
> "Recursa is like inception but for code LOL 🤯" (too casual, meme-y)

> "Unlike those OTHER frameworks..." (punching down)

> "Warning: side effects may include mass productivity" (trying too hard)
