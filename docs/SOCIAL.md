# Social Media Guidelines

> Standards for Recursa's presence across social platforms

## Platform Strategy

### Primary Platforms

| Platform | Purpose | Audience | Tone |
|----------|---------|----------|------|
| **GitHub** | Product home, community | Developers | Precise, helpful |
| **Twitter/X** | Announcements, engagement | Dev community | Witty, conversational |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional reach | Tech leaders, companies | Thoughtful, professional |
| **Discord/Slack** | Community support | Active users | Warm, collaborative |

### Secondary Platforms

| Platform | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **YouTube** | Tutorials, deep dives | Learners |
| **Dev.to/Hashnode** | Long-form content | Developer readers |
| **Reddit** | Community discussions | r/programming, etc. |

## Content Types

### Announcements

New releases, features, milestones.

**Template:**
```
[What's new] + [Why it matters] + [How to try it] + [Optional wit]

Example:
"LOOP.md just got smarter—v1.2 adds automatic reflection prompts.
Your system now asks itself the right questions (so you don't have to).
Try it: [link]
Because talking to yourself is only weird if you're not learning."
```

### Tips & Insights

Bite-sized value for the community.

**Template:**
```
[Pattern/insight] + [Why it works] + [Try this]

Example:
"The best self-improving systems fail fast and learn faster.
That's why METRICS.md tracks 'failed experiments' as a feature, not a bug.
What's the last thing your project learned from going wrong?"
```

### Engagement Posts

Questions, polls, community interaction.

**Template:**
```
[Question that invites response] + [Optional personal take]

Example:
"What's the smallest feedback loop in your current project?
(Ours is the git commit hook that reminds us to update LEARNING.md)"
```

### Behind-the-Scenes

Process, decisions, building in public.

**Template:**
```
[What we're doing] + [Why we're doing it this way] + [What we learned]

Example:
"Spent the morning debating whether SOUL.md should include personality traits.
Decided yes—systems need identity to make consistent decisions.
(Also, we needed to justify why ours is 'curious but precise with occasional wit')"
```

## Stories & Ephemeral Content

### Instagram/Twitter Stories Format

Stories are for quick, casual, behind-the-scenes content.

**Story Types:**

1. **Build Log**
   - Screenshot of code/docs being written
   - Brief caption: "Working on v1.3's reflection engine"
   - Poll: "Should we add auto-generated insights?"

2. **Quote Cards**
   - Brand-styled quote graphic
   - Text: A pithy insight about self-improvement
   - Example: "The loop improves the loop that improves the loop."

3. **Quick Tips**
   - Single actionable tip
   - Swipe-up to full documentation
   - Example: "Pro tip: Name your LOOP.md phases as verbs. 'Define, Create, Review' not 'Definition, Creation, Review'"

4. **Community Spotlight**
   - Reshare of community project
   - Brief commentary: "Look what @user built with Recursa"

5. **Memes (Carefully)**
   - On-brand humor about recursion/self-improvement
   - Never punch down at competitors or users
   - Self-deprecating humor is fine

### Story Style Guidelines

- Use brand colors (Recursa Indigo, Deep Navy)
- Consistent typography (Inter)
- Include logo mark subtly
- Keep text minimal
- Add captions for accessibility

## Voice by Platform

### Twitter/X Voice

- Shorter sentences
- More wit and wordplay
- Emojis sparingly (max 1-2 per post)
- Questions to drive engagement
- Threads for depth

**Good:**
> "Your code called itself. Intentionally. And it worked.
> That's not a bug, that's a feature.
> Welcome to recursive systems."

**Avoid:**
> "Check out our NEW FEATURE!!! 🚀🔥💯
> Recursa is AMAZING for building self-improving systems!!!"

### LinkedIn Voice

- Full sentences, professional
- Less wit, more insight
- Focused on outcomes and value
- Occasional personal reflection
- No excessive hashtags

**Good:**
> "The most interesting systems I've seen recently don't just process data—they learn from it.
>
> Recursa provides architecture for this kind of self-improvement. Define your loop, measure your outcomes, and capture what you learn.
>
> It's not magic. It's structured reflection."

**Avoid:**
> "Excited to announce Recursa!!! 🎉 This game-changing framework will revolutionize how you build software! #AI #Innovation #StartupLife"

### Discord/Slack Voice

- Conversational, helpful
- More casual, can use more emojis
- Quick to respond
- Collaborative, not authoritative

**Good:**
> "hey! yeah the LOOP.md file is where you define your iteration cycle. think of it like 'what happens every time you do a unit of work.' happy to walk through an example if that helps 👍"

## Hashtags

### Primary (Always include one)

- `#Recursa`
- `#SelfImprovingSystems`

### Secondary (Contextual)

- `#MetaFramework`

## Response Guidelines

### Responding to Praise

Be grateful, deflect to community:
> "Thank you! The community's contributions make Recursa what it is. What are you building with it?"

### Responding to Criticism

Acknowledge, don't defend:
> "Fair point—we've been thinking about this too. Mind opening an issue so we can discuss? Would love your input on a solution."

### Responding to Questions

Be helpful, invite deeper engagement:
> "Great question! Short answer: [answer]. Longer explanation in the docs here: [link]. If that doesn't cover it, drop by Discord and we'll dig in."

### Responding to Feature Requests

Show curiosity:
> "Interesting idea! What problem would this solve for you? Would love to understand the use case."

## Content Calendar Rhythm

| Day | Content Type |
|-----|--------------|
| Monday | Tip or insight |
| Wednesday | Announcement or update (if any) |

## Crisis Guidelines

If something goes wrong publicly:

1. **Acknowledge quickly** - Don't ignore or delete
2. **Be honest** - Explain what happened
3. **Take responsibility** - If it's our fault, say so
4. **Share the fix** - What we're doing about it
5. **Learn publicly** - Add to LEARNING.md and share the lesson

**Template:**
> "We messed up. [What happened]. We're sorry to everyone affected. Here's what we're doing: [fix]. We've added this to our learnings so it doesn't happen again. Full post-mortem: [link]"
