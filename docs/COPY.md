### Repository Description (Short)
```
A meta-framework for building self-improving systems. Define your loop, track your learnings, evolve your process.
```

### Repository Description (Extended)
```
Recursa is a meta-framework for building systems that improve themselves.

Traditional systems: Input → Process → Output
Self-improving systems: Input → Process → Output → Evaluate → Learn → Improve ↩

You define how your system works (LOOP.md), how it evaluates itself (METRICS.md),
and how it captures learnings (LEARNING.md). Recursa provides the architecture
that connects it all.

Works with any AI assistant: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, or just plain markdown.

Recursa is a meta-framework for building self-improving systems. We provide the architecture for feedback loops, structured reflection, and continuous learning—for codebases, processes, and anything that needs to get better over time.

Open source. Works with any AI assistant.

Headline: Systems that learn to improve themselves

Subhead: Recursa is a meta-framework for building feedback loops into anything you build. Define your process, track your outcomes, capture your learnings—and watch your system evolve.

```

### What is Recursa?
```
Most systems stay the same. Input goes in, output comes out, nothing changes.

Self-improving systems are different. They evaluate their outputs, learn from the results, and adjust their process. They get better over time without manual intervention.

Recursa provides the architecture for building these systems:

• LOOP.md — Define your iteration cycle
• METRICS.md — Track what matters
• LEARNING.md — Capture accumulated knowledge
• SOUL.md — Establish consistent identity and values

It's not magic. It's structured reflection, made practical.
```

### How It Works
```
1. Bootstrap your project
   Tell Recursa what you're building. It asks the right questions and generates customized templates.

2. Define your loop
   Every self-improving system has an iteration unit. What's yours? A blog post? A PR review? A customer interaction?

3. Run iterations
   Do your work. At the end of each cycle, Recursa prompts you to evaluate and capture learnings.

4. Watch it compound
   Over time, your system accumulates knowledge. Patterns emerge. Your process evolves.
```

### Why Recursa?
```
→ Framework-agnostic — Works with any AI assistant or just plain markdown
→ Domain-agnostic — Blog writing, code review, research, CRM, learning—anything
→ Principled architecture — Based on seven layers from identity to safety
→ Actually open source — MIT license, no strings attached
→ Built recursively — Recursa improves itself using its own framework
```

### FAQ Snippets

**Is this an AI product?**
```
No. Recursa is a framework—a collection of markdown templates and conventions. It works beautifully with AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), but it's just as useful with pen and paper. The intelligence comes from structured reflection, not from any AI magic.
```

**What can I build with it?**
```
Anything that benefits from iteration and improvement:
• Content creation systems (blogs, newsletters, documentation)
• Development workflows (code review, testing, deployment)
• Research pipelines (literature review, synthesis, discovery)
• Personal systems (learning, habits, relationship management)
• Business processes (sales, support, operations)

If it has a loop, Recursa can help it learn.
```

**Is this just a todo list?**
```
No. Todo lists track tasks. Recursa tracks learnings.

The difference: a todo list helps you remember what to do. Recursa helps your system remember what it's learned, so the next iteration is better than the last.

(Though yes, there's a todo list component. Loops need to track their work.)
```

**What's the catch?**
```
It requires effort. Self-improvement isn't automatic—you have to actually reflect and capture learnings. Recursa provides the structure, but you provide the discipline.

The good news: the framework makes it easier, and the compounding effects make it worthwhile.

### Welcome Email
```
Subject: Welcome to Recursa — let's build something that learns

Hey [name],

Thanks for trying Recursa. You just joined a community of builders who believe systems should get better over time.

Here's where to start:

1. Read the Quick Start (5 min): [link]
2. Bootstrap your first project: `recursa init ~/my-project`
3. Join the Discord: [link]

One tip: Start small. Pick one process you want to improve, and let Recursa help you iterate on it. You can always expand later.

Questions? Reply to this email or drop by Discord. We're friendly.

Welcome to the loop,
The Recursa team

## Presentation Copy

### Conference Talk Intro
```
"The best systems I've encountered have something in common: they don't just work—they improve.

Recursa is a meta-framework for building that improvement into any system you create. Today I'll show you how feedback loops, structured reflection, and accumulated learning can transform how you build software, content, or really anything that iterates."
```

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
```
"Recursa is a framework for building self-improving systems. You define how your system works, how it evaluates itself, and how it learns. Then each iteration compounds on the last. It works with AI assistants like Claude or Cursor, but it's really just structured markdown. Open source, MIT licensed."
```

### One-liner for Intros
```
"I work on Recursa—it's a framework for building systems that get better over time."
```

## Error & Empty States

### No Results
```
Nothing here yet.
That's not a bug—it's a blank canvas. Start your first iteration to populate this space.
```

### Loading
```
Processing... (this is the part where systems improve themselves)
```

### Error (Generic)
```
Something went wrong.
We've logged this so we can learn from it. (Recursive self-improvement in action.)
Try again, or let us know if it persists.
```

### Success
```
Done! Your changes have been saved.
The loop continues.
```

## Witty Alternatives

For when the context calls for levity:

### Loading
```
- "Recursing..."
- "Asking ourselves what we learned..."
- "Loop in progress..."
```

### 404
```
"This page called itself so many times it disappeared.
(Stack overflow, but for web pages.)
Let's get you back: [Home]"
```

### Empty State
```
"Nothing to see here. Yet.
Every self-improving system starts empty.
The magic is in what happens next."
```

### Welcome Back
```
"You're back! Your system remembers.
(That's kind of the whole point.)"
```
